# stock market prediction using a neural net

This project was initially meant to be a way of combining learning about neural nets and using tensorflow and make money on the stock market at the same time. However, it become quickly evident my model suffered from overfitting, although I tried a few things to reduce this, it quickly became apparent that stock market is not the best data to learn neural nets with.

Overview:\
[1. Curation of a stock market data set using webscraping and APIs]()\
[2. Training and testing of a LSTM model]()\
[3. Predict tomorrows highest risers]()
